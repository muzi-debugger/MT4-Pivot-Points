# MT4 Pivot Points Solution

## Overview

Day traders have a lot to do on a daily basis, from monitoring price action, identifying entry levels, stop loss levels, support and resistance levels etc. This solution aims to reduce identifying entry and exit points through pivot points.
A pivot point and its support/resistance levels are areas at which the direction of price movement can possibly change. This reduces the need to manually identify the pivot point where the direction of price may change but the key take-away is that this custom pivot point indicator shows support and resistance levels so that you don't have to and what's more is that it is automatically updates daily based on the closing price.


## How To Use The Code
Open the MetaEditor in MetaTrader 4 (Tools > MetaQuotes Language Editor).
This will show a popup, select Custom Indicator > OnCalculate > Finish
Create a new Indicator file (File > New > Custom Indicator)
Clone the repo > copy paste in the editor > save > compile
Return to MT4 > indicators > Custom > Select the created indicator 

This will now show pivot points on your chart simplifying the need to manually insert support and resistance levels.
There is much more that I intend to do with this, however, for the sake of making my offering free I have decided to showcase the simplified solution on my public GitHub repo. Enjoy!
